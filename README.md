agrad2
======

Exploratory work on successor to the [stan-dev/stan](https://github.com/stan-dev/stan) package 
in namespace ```stan::agrad```.

Inspired by Robin Hogan's package

* [Adept: A fast automatic differentiation library for C++](http://www.met.reading.ac.uk/clouds/adept/).

I'm going to try a simpler approach to memory management and assignment that's more like what we did in Stan.
